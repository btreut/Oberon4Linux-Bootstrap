# Bootstrap Loader - Oberon V4 for Linux

The Bootstrap Loader contained in the latest Version (1.7.02, dated 2004) of Oberon V4 for 
Linux available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/oberon/files/Oberon%20V4%20for%20GNU_Linux
does not compile under current versions of gcc.

Since I am not a C-Guru I needed a lot help of ChatGPT, but with that help I was able to update the 
bootloader, so that it is compilable and runnable under a more or less current (Debian oldstable, i.e. 
bookworm) 64bit Linux System.

More stuff will follow real soon.
